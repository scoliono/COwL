Custom Overwatch Lobby (Designer)

Fairly self-explanitory.
A quick-and-dirty webapp made for designing and sharing Overwatch custom lobbies.

Fork this and make it not suck as much if you want.

##Features:
* Interactive menus!
* A way of importing and exporting games!
* A way to name your stuff!
* An eternal loathing for how D.Va's name interacts with jQuery!
* A plain-English way of telling your friends how to make thing!

## TODO:
* ~~More Advanced Import/Export Functionality~~ DONE
* ~~Converting Webpage from Tree to Page structure~~ DONE (LAZILY)
* Individual Hero Statistics (WIP)
* Prettifying things (WIP)
* Reset-To-Default buttons (Planned)
